A Music Visualizer Written in Processing. Initially my contribution to our group's "Computing and the Arts" semester final project, now a side project of sorts.

Add songs to "data" [mp3, wav], use numeric keys to switch vis screens.
<br/>Space skips a song, left goes back. E,S,A,C,D,X toggle different modes, explore.
